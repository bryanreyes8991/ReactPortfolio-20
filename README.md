# Porfolio made with React + Vite

## Overview 
This portfolio is a reflection of the implementation of the javascript library React and the Vite bundler. These are a popular choice amongst many developers today. Like any other JS library issues may arise if not used in the right sense although overall I feel that react is a simpler choice amongst the many other restrictive and heavily documented libraries that may exist. As of now it feels that React is fairly simple to compose.
